To-Do List
==========

- [ ] wrap a little gui around this so non-devs can play
- [ ] add cool 'kill' effect (explosion, other)
- [ ] the drawing can be made faster by using 'copy'

Code Refactoring
----------------

- [ ] rename the classes and files to represent what this code became (it didn't start out to be a game)
- [ ] reconsider the actors/design (again, this didn't start out to become this game)
